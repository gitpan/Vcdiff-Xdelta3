NAME
    Vcdiff::Xdelta3 - Xdelta3 backend for Vcdiff

SYNOPSIS
        use Vcdiff::Xdelta3;

        my $delta = Vcdiff::Xdelta3::diff($source, $target);

        my $target2 = Vcdiff::Xdelta3::patch($source, $delta);

        ## $target2 eq $target

    This module is a backend to the Vcdiff module and isn't usually used
    directly.

DESCRIPTION
    Xdelta3 is a delta encoding library by Joshua MacDonald. The Xdelta3
    source code is embedded into this module and built as a shared object.
    The "xdelta3" command-line binary is not built.

PROS
    *   Doesn't have arbitrary size limitations on source, target, or delta
        files.

    *   Has a really neat feature that lets you merge VCDIFF deltas into a
        single delta. Unfortunately this module doesn't expose that yet.

CONS
    *   GPL licensed

    *   Build system is really weird. I didn't bother figuring out how to
        run Xdelta3's test-suite when installing the CPAN module which is
        unfortunate. Note that installing this module does still run the
        shared test-suite in Vcdiff.
